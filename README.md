# Michel Steuwer ([he/him](http://pronoun.is/he))

I am a lecturer (assistant professor) in compilers and runtime systems in the [School of Informatics](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics/) at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/) in Scotland. I am a member of the [Compiler and Architecture Design Group (CArD)](http://www.icsa.inf.ed.ac.uk/compilers/), the [Institute for Computing Systems Architecture (ICSA)](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/icsa/), and a honorary member of staff at the [School of Computing Science at the University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/).

Before joining the faculty in Edinburgh I was a lecturer in the [School of Computing Science](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/) at the [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/). Prior to that I was a postdoctoral researcher at the [School of Informatics](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/) at the [University of Edinburgh](http://www.ed.ac.uk/). I received my PhD from the [University of MÃ¼nster](http://www.wwu.de/en) in Germany.

## Research Focus
I am interested in all aspects of parallel programming and compiler design. Particular research interests of mine include performance portability, structured parallel programming, functional programming languages, heterogeneous and GPU computing, and novel compilation techniques for high-level languages.
