# [Michel Steuwer](https://michel.steuwer.info) ([he/him](http://pronoun.is/he))

I am a professor leading the Chair of Compilers and Programming Languages at [Technische Universität Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin).

Before joining TU Berlin, I was a lecturer at the [University of Edinburgh](http://www.ed.ac.uk/) and the [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/). Prior to that I was a postdoctoral researcher at the [University of Edinburgh](http://www.ed.ac.uk/). I received my PhD from the [University of Münster](http://www.wwu.de/en) in Germany.

## Research Focus
I am interested in all aspects of parallel programming and compiler design. Particular research interests of mine include performance portability, structured parallel programming, functional programming languages, heterogeneous and GPU computing, and novel compilation techniques for high-level languages.
